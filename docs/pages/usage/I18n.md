# I18n

All uiv components use `en-US` as default language and they are both configurable.

## Example

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import uiv from 'uiv'
import locale from 'uiv/src/locale/lang/zh-CN'

Vue.use(uiv, { locale })
```

As you see, we can also create custom wordings if not satisfied with the defaults, simply create your own `locale` object and replace with the one in example code will do.

## With `vue-i18n`

uiv is compatible with [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) as well.

**Note**: You need to merge uiv language packs into your app's. For example:

```javascript
import uivLocale from 'uiv/src/locale/lang/zh-CN'

let appLocale = Object.assign({}, uivLocale, {
  // ...
})
```
